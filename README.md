# Eclipse MicroProfile with Kotlin

An example implementation of the Eclipse MicroProfile 1.3 with JTA, Arquillian and Payara Micro in Kotlin. Later I will add a Vue.js front-end including an automatic build pipeline.

## Getting Started

To start the application execute the Gradle task `run`. Java 9 or newer is not supported by Payara Micro and the ShrinkWrap Resolver for Gradle.

### Prerequisites

No Prerequisites except Java. Everything else is inside this repository.
